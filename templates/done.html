<p>That's it! You should now see a folder <code>Dropbox/Apps/Easter Eggs</code>.<br>(If you deployed this app yourself, the name of that folder will instead match the name you gave when you created your Dropbox app.)</p>
<p>The hunt is on! Find the egg files and add them to your "Easter basket" folder. When you've found all five, come back here and click "Finished!"</p>
