<p>That's it! You should now see a folder <code>Dropbox/Apps/Easter Eggs</code>.<br>(If you deployed this app yourself, the name of that folder will instead match the name you gave when you created your Dropbox app.)</p>
<p>Put image files in that folder and watch them get converted! (Your image won't be overridden. A new file called <code>&lt;filename-converted.jpg&gt;</code> will be added.)</p>
